# WVM
A virtual machine which allows the model of a single computer to be emulated while the resources of several computers are used, thus making it possible to increase computational competition. WVM is a collection of software libraries and communication tools for computer networks that allows a network of computers to be aggregated into a single virtual machine.

This virtual machine allows in particular two principles, the guarantee of the security of the programs running on it (in particular against DDOS for example, like the EVM) and to interpret and compile these programs written in Fidus, the native programming language of the Wia blockchain, allowing the operation of smart-contracts, ricardians-contracts and oracles. It also allows the use of a virtual and parallel memory model offering a kind of decentralized cloud to the nodes of the network.


In the long run, this virtual machine will allow the establishment of a so-called "decentralized internet system, allowing users to create, store and deploy web pages and platforms using resources such as bandwidth, space. hosting and code deployment environments at very low cost.

Storage hypervisor, a centrally managed monitoring software program, provides a comprehensive set of storage management and monitoring functions that operates as a transparent virtual layer between consolidated disk pools to improve availability, speed and use.

Storage hypervisors leverage the combined benefits of multiple disk storage systems, including different and incompatible models, by supplementing their respective capabilities with extensive provisioning, replication, and performance acceleration services.
