THIRD-GENERATION BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain has been able to overcome its major problem
called Scaling in the process of evolution. Blockchain 3.0
expands numerous applications not involving the currency,
cash, or ﬁnancial sector. It brings us smart cities with smart
governance; smart resource utilization by smart citizens
bringing us a smart economy. Blockchain’s integration with
the Internet of Things is being developed to implement smart
property transactions and data payment without third party
involvement. Such incorporation can also set up a market
for power from machine to machine and handle electronic
medical records information.
Blockchain 3.0 is beneﬁcial in digital identity where
unbanked customers can maintain their identities so that
banks can complete their formalities such as Know YouCustomer and access bank accounts. In this internet era,
many of the transactions are done between unknown people.
Saving data in the block and carrying transactions through
the blockchain network would bring trustworthy customers,
which leads to a decrease in fraud rating [45].
4) MINING
Mining can be deﬁned as adding blocks to the openly dis-
tributed ledger, which is called the blockchain. People who
mine Bitcoin get rewards for more mining. Miners present in
each node mine the blocks and sometimes get paid a reward
for mining.
E. NODES OF BLOCKCHAIN
A node in the blockchain can be deﬁned as the device belong-
ing to the blockchain network. The type of node is classiﬁed
based upon the task done by it. There are different kinds of
nodes. They are:
1. Mining Nodes: Mining nodes always produce blocks for
the blockchain. These nodes just verify whether the block
can be added to the list in the process called mining.
Mining nodes are not responsible for maintaining blocks;
they only create blocks and add them to the chain. Added
blocks are published over the network where full nodes
validate them and add them to the blockchain.
2. Full or Super Nodes: Full node control maintains and
sends the copies of blocks to all the network nodes. Their
job is to validate transactions until the genesis block
during publishing. After validation, the data is sent to
all other nodes in the network to ensure the blockchains
trustworthiness. When are there are more nodes with a
more decentralized network, it would become tough to
hack it. A Node can be called a Super Node depending
upon the count of exchange of transactions produced from
a full node. Super Nodes are always active and connect the
remaining full nodes and make them appear all over the
network.
3. Light Nodes: Light nodes exhibit similar behavior as full
nodes, but they contain only a portion of the whole block.
They contain only the previous transaction blocker and
validate the blockchain and inform the network’s remain-
ing nodes. Light nodes are connected to the parent node,
i.e., Full node, and are not as powerful. Whenever a full
node is hacked and is holding the corrupted data, the light
node can capture and dismiss that blockchain as false and
give the complete node information to a blockchain that
should be maintaining. As these don’t occupy much data
space, they help make the network more decentralized and
travel long distances at a lower cost than full nodes.
F. LAYERS OF BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain doesn’t contain any hierarchical structure. Six
layers can explain it: data, network, consensus, contract, ser-
vice, and application, as shown in ﬁgure 1. Data and Network
layers gather data and validate it. In the consensus layer, con-
FIGURE 1. Layers of blockchain.
TABLE 4. Given Components Present in Each Layer of Blockchain.
sensus algorithms are involved for veriﬁcation [45]. Smart
contracts are used in the contract layer to implement trust.
The services and Application layers implement blockchain
activities. In table 4, we mentioned the components present
in each layer of blockchain. In the data layer, we have Data
block, timestamp, Merkle root tree, hashing. In the network
layer, peer-to-peer network, veriﬁcation mechanism, broad
protocols are the components. The consensus layer contains
different consensus algorithms like Proof of Work, Proof
of Stake, Byzantine Fault algorithms, etc. In the contract
layer, we have smart contracts, incentive mechanisms, script
coding. In the service layer, we have Ethereum, Hyperledger
Fabric, IBM Azure, etc.
G. HASHING
Hashing can be deﬁned in simple terms as identifying a
speciﬁc object from a set of similar objects. A large amount
of data is converted into a hash key using hash functions.
The value obtained by using a hash function is stored in the
data structure called a hash table. The hash function is always
used to map a data set that falls into a hash table. The value
obtained is called hash value or hash code [10].
H. SMART CONTRACTS
In 1994, Nick Szabo initiated smart contracts in the form of
automated transaction protocol. The concept of smart con-
tracts introduced earlier than blockchain technology. A smart
contract can be deﬁned in digital form as a series of com-
mitments [69]. The relationship between the parties is being
built by rules that build trust between the parties who do
not know each other. In a blockchain, Smart Contracts are
deﬁned as a program written in programmable languages that

Ethereum.
run in a container. The data present in the block will give be
executed within the blockchain, which offers trustworthiness
and uniqueness. As the data of smart contracts is present in the
blockchain, the data is tamper-proof and anti-counterfeiting.
The smart contract enables self-execution when a speciﬁc
condition is met on all the nodes present in the network
[43]. It also helps the parties predict the outcomes as the
contract execution depends on the code available on a public
network, and they are veriﬁable as they are already signed
[45]. Smart contracts can maintain smart asserts and assert
transactions. They are also useful during loans, mortgages,
agreements between business individuals. Some research
offers the results that smart contracts can have the ability to
evaluate effectiveness, availability, and scalability. TDD (Test
Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior Driven Develop-
ment) evaluate smart contracts’ accuracy. Ethereum is the
best example which is building smart contracts [34].
I. DIGITAL SIGNATU RES
A digital signature can be deﬁned as digitally signed data sent
from one-to-one or one-to-many, ensuring no data loss. Every
client will have a private key and a public key. If a client wants
to send any data, they must generate the hash value from
the transaction data and then use their private key to encrypt
the hash value. This process is called ‘digital signing,’ and
the stage is called ‘signing.’ The digitally signed transactions
are distributed throughout the network to nodes present. The
payment information received will be decrypted using the
public key of the recipient [20]. The decrypted hash value is
checked by comparing it with the hash value obtained from
the sender’s data. This phase is called the veriﬁcation phase.
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used
for veriﬁcation in the blockchain [60].
J. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF B LOCKCHAIN
PLATFORMS
1) PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS COMPARISON BETWEEN
BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM
In table 5, the comparison between the blockchain platforms
called Bitcoin and Ethereum is shown. We have considered
Block size, Block time, number of transactions, and difﬁculty
creating the block [62].
Block Size: the average size of Bitcoin is 1 MB, and the
Ethereum block size varies from 2000 bytes to 2800 bytes.
Block Time: The time taken by Bitcoin to create a block
is 600 seconds to 10 minutes, whereas Ethereum can create
within 15 seconds
TABLE 6. Comparison Between Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.
No of Transactions: As Bitcoin takes more time to create
a block and transact, the number of transactions are signif-
icantly less than Ethereum, and also Ethereum has become
popular recently
Difﬁculty: The difﬁculty in creating the block in Bitcoin
takes 25 million Terhash per second, and the creation of
Ethereum will not be much.
2) COMPARISON BETWEEN HYPERLEDGER FABRIC AND
ETHEREUM
In table 6, the comparison between blockchain platforms
called Hyperledger fabric and Ethereum is shown. We have
considered parameters called Average throughput, CPU Uti-
lization, Memory Utilization, Network Utilization, Execution
time, and Average latency [62].
K. BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS
Various blockchain applications are emerging in our day-
to-day lives. The applications include food supply chain,
Asset management, Insurance claims, smart car, smartphone,
e-passport, smart appliances, health care management, and
personal health record-keeping, and so on.
1) BLOCKCHAIN IN FINANCE
Bank activities are intermediaries in the traditional method
and system transactions. Such payments are prone to errors
as many intermediary parties maintain the record. This whole
process takes time and costs more [69]. This problem is sim-
pliﬁed by introducing blockchain technology that uses a dis-
tributed public ledger in which miners verify the transactions
using ‘‘Proof-of-work.’’ The blockchain provides many ser-
vices to the ﬁnancial world. Some of them are:
1. 1. Cryptocurrency: Like Bitcoin, many cryptocurrencies
are introduced to the world that uses blockchain technol-
ogy. There is no need for a trusted third-party like a bank
in traditional systems. All payments can be checked and
unchanged.
2. 2. Global Payments: Global payments are time-
consuming because many intermediaries will verify the
transactions. Blockchain technology is beneﬁcial in these
situations. It reduces the complexity of verifying by intro-
ducing the decentralized public ledger. With the peer-to-
peer network’s help, global payments are made faster,
veriﬁable, immutable, and safer.
3. 3. Insurance Claims and Processing: Many fraudulent
claims are coming up in the insurance sector. These

defective claims can be avoided in a secure manner using
Blockchain distributed ledger technology.
2) BLOCKCHAIN IN HEALTHCARE
Blockchain is useful for personal health databases and infor-
mation sharing centers’, is a smart platform for medical
assistance and an in-depth analysis of the medical challenges.
The patient’s necessary information, medical history, test
results, treatment records, drug prescriptions, and diagnostic
effects are stored in a digital record called The Electronic
Health Record (EHR). Continuous processing of data on
cloud servers helps reduce the risk of medical data failure
and increases the safety and accuracy of medical information.
Health data and medical records are helpful for clinicians to
verify the health status of a person. The health database allows
doctors to understand the condition of the patient quickly. The
medical database is for extensive data analysis and mining for
hospitals and medical research centers. The smart contracts in
the blockchain can help build a smart medical management
system to form medical contracts and vouchers [45].
3) BLOCKCHAIN IN DATA PROVENANCE
Data provenance means data processing management,
addressing data status, and source. The provenance of data
is carried out in managing scientiﬁc data, data storage, and
data assets. Blockchain technology and smart contracts can
be used to enforce data provenance and to check the asset’s
integrity and ownership. It also helps with the traceability of
the product and can also have a multi-stakeholder traceability
chain. It is also useful for applications such as forensics and
accountability.
4) BLOCKCHAIN IN 5G NETWORK
In 5G networks, Heterogeneous devices and applications
need to be coordinated to improve energy efﬁciency, net-
work capacity, and resource accessibility. We could build a
business model combining blockchain and smart contracts
to collaborate industrial automation processes and related
manufacturing equipment to achieve efﬁcient operations.
In the traditional approach, there is a need for a network
slice broker for resource allocation facilities [8]. However,
using blockchain, we could have cloud radio over an optical
ﬁber network to adopt an anonymous access identiﬁcation
mechanism to reduce the cost of operating and connecting
the network and make a joint agreement between the parties.
5) BLOCKCHAIN IN AVIATION SYSTEMS
Blockchain will provide digital operator and product provider
alliances to provide secure decentralized travel services and
products. Smart contracts can also work together between
companies and different units within the company.
6) BLOCKCHAIN IN SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS
Smart sensors are used in traditional supply chain systems to
collect information about the supply chain as it is transported.
Shortly, the number of sensors is expected to rise rapidly.
Blockchain technology would, therefore, help maintain the
massive amount of data to be collected and analyzed. The
information in a distributed network would be robust and
stable.
7) BLOCKCHAIN IN SMART HOMES
Blockchain integration with the Internet of Things will help
make smart home appliance operations efﬁcient and safe.
8) BLOCKCHAIN IN SMART PROPERTY
In the distributed ledger technology, all properties such as
home, property, cars, and smart devices can be represented.
Blockchain keeps track of all devices and their operations.
The records can be shared with legit persons whenever we
want and can establish contacts between multiple parties [20].
1. Hard money lending: Hard money lending is very
common nowadays. The borrower needs to have a property
to keep it as collateral to lend the money. Borrowers can
do fraud using illicit assets as collateral or by borrowers if
they are using dishonest policies as part of the agreement.
The property can be checked before it is taken as collateral
by using Blockchain technology, and smart contracts can
agree. It improves trust, brings transparency and security even
among strangers.
2. Cars and Phones: Using authentication keys,
205198 VOLUME 8, 2020

FIGURE 2. The general architecture of a blockchain.
personal devices are protected, and cars are accessible only
to owners using smart keys. Using cryptography, this can be
kept safe. But if the authentication key is stolen or copied, or
transferred, there are chances of failure. Using a blockchain
ledger to replace and replicate lost credentials would
ﬁx this.
9) BLOCKCHAIN IN OTHER INDUSTRIES
Blockchain has numerous applications such as Energy Cyber-
Physical System, Vehicular Cyber-Physical System in the
Internet of Things, on the Internet of Battle-ﬁeld Things
IoBT), Cyber Security, Smart Appliances, Asset Manage-
ment, Cloud Storage, Intellectual Property, Food Safety,
Blockchain Notary, Fundraising and transparency, wireless
networks and Virtualization, Real estate, Identity manage-
ment like Academic records, Blockchain Music, Birth, Mar-
riage and Death Certiﬁcates, Passports, Personal Identity and
Privacy, Voting, etc. Because the blockchain is a decentral-
ized, stable, open, and scalable network, it will supply future
energy internet growth.
10) BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE
Blockchain would be like a sequence of blocks that hold the
entire data belonging to a network in an open public ledger.
There are a block header and a block body in each block.
As shown in ﬁgure 2, there are six main components in the
block header [24]. They are:
1. Block version: This allows us to follow the set of block
validation rules.
2. Merkle tree root hash: The data is encrypted with hash-
ing algorithms when a transaction occurs, and then it is
transmitted to each node. Because it could contain thou-
sands of transaction records in the block of each node,
the Merkle tree function was used by the blockchain to
produce a ﬁnal hash value and Merkle tree root.
3. Timestamp: Produces timestamp with the current time
as seconds for every block
4. Difﬁculty target: threshold of a valid hash block.
5. Nonce: A 4-byte ﬁeld that usually begins at zero and
increases with each hash calculation
6. Parent block hash: The value of 256-bit hash points to
the previous block.
L. WORKING OF BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain technology suggests building blocks containing
data and is linked to the chain. Blocks are linked together
through each block containing the previous block header
[27]. If some data is changed in the previous block, the hash
key will change, and hence the mismatch of the hash key
will happen in the chain of blocks. It prevents the data
from tampering. When a user wants to send some transac-
tion data to others, that transaction will be represented as
a block. The block must be broadcast to all other nodes on
the network to add the blockchain block. Miners of the node
need to approve the transaction. The miners get the authority
to approve a block by solving computationally challenging
problems when the block is created. The block is added
to the blockchain after authentication, which completes the
transaction. The next step is to decide which user published
the next block. The collection of validated blocks is combined
into a chain that forms a blockchain network [69].
M. CONSENSUS ALGORITHMS
When a block is needed to be added into the blockchain, that
block needs to be veriﬁed as a valid one by all the nodes
in the network. Consensus algorithms are a kind of protocol
that maintains the nodes involved in the blockchain network
to reach a transaction order decision and ﬁlter invalid trans-
actions. More than one transaction is competing with each
other to get published to obtain the reward of the transaction.
To solve the decision problem, consensus algorithms came
into existence. It is also difﬁcult for the miners to reach a con-
sensus because, without a central authority, the blockchain
network is distributed [69
